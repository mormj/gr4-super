# Building GNU Radio 4

This guide covers the local development workspace. For the browser and desktop
Studio launch paths, see [Studio](studio.md).

## Requirements

The core stack uses C++23 and requires:

- CMake 3.27 or newer
- Ninja
- Git
- GCC 14 or newer (GCC 15+ recommended), or a current Clang (Clang 20+
  recommended)

The full workspace additionally requires Node.js 22 and npm. Individual
modules can require further system packages. Development presets allow the
child projects to fetch selected dependencies; the `offline` profile uses only
system dependencies.

## Standard profiles

Configure, build, and activate using the same profile name:

```sh
cmake --preset dev
cmake --build --preset dev
source build/dev/activate.sh
```

| Preset | Configuration | Intended use | Install prefix |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `dev` | RelWithAssert, tests, warnings as errors | Normal development | `install/` |
| `debug` | Debug, tests | Debugger-friendly development | `install/debug/` |
| `release` | Release, no tests | Performance and install validation | `install/release/` |
| `asan` | Debug, tests, AddressSanitizer | Memory-error diagnostics | `install/asan/` |
| `ubsan` | Debug, tests, UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer | Undefined-behavior diagnostics | `install/ubsan/` |
| `offline` | RelWithAssert, tests, system dependencies | No dependency downloads | `install/offline/` |
| `ci` | RelWithAssert, tests, warnings as errors | Base-stack integration CI | `install/ci/` |
| `full` | RelWithAssert, tests, incubator, control-plane, Studio | Complete application development | `install/full/` |
| `full-ci` | RelWithAssert, tests, incubator, control-plane, Studio | Complete integration CI | `install/full-ci/` |

Discover the profiles available in the current checkout:

```sh
cmake --list-presets
cmake --build --list-presets
```

## Control parallelism

Set `CMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL` before configuring if compilation uses too
much memory. It is propagated to nested CMake component builds:

```sh
export CMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL=4
cmake --preset dev
cmake --build --preset dev
```

To store the limit in a profile instead, pass
`-DGR4_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL=4` during configuration. That option takes
precedence over `CMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL`.

`cmake --build --parallel N`, `-jN`, and a build preset's `jobs` value control
only the outer superbuild; they do not limit the nested component builds. The
Studio npm, TypeScript, and Vite steps use their own concurrency controls.

## Source ownership and incremental builds

On the first build, CMake clones missing component repositories into `src/` at
their configured refs. Once a checkout exists, the superbuild does not fetch,
pull, switch, reset, or replace it. Updating it and choosing its branch are the
developer's responsibility. A newly cloned source may be detached; create a
branch in the child repository before making commits.

The child builds are separate and share one install prefix. Re-running the
outer build invokes required child builds, while their Ninja builds remain
incremental. To clone selected sources without compiling:

```sh
cmake --build --preset dev --target sources
```

Use `full` instead of `dev` to include incubator, control-plane, and Studio.
Remove one child's build state without deleting its source or shared prefix:

```sh
cmake --build --preset dev --target gnuradio4-blocks-clean
```

## Build individual components

Targets include their upstream dependencies:

```sh
cmake --build --preset dev --target gnuradio4-core
cmake --build --preset dev --target gnuradio4-library
cmake --build --preset dev --target gnuradio4-blocks
```

For full-workspace targets:

```sh
cmake --build --preset full --target gnuradio4-control-plane
cmake --build --preset full --target gr4-incubator
cmake --build --preset full --target gnuradio4-studio-blocks
cmake --build --preset full --target gnuradio4-studio
```

## macOS with Homebrew

The Apple Clang supplied by the Command Line Tools can be too old for the
C++23 features used by GR4. `CMakeUserPresets.json.mac.example` selects
Homebrew LLVM and provides `dev-mac` and `full-mac` profiles. It assumes the
Apple Silicon Homebrew prefix; replace `/opt/homebrew` with `/usr/local` on
Intel Macs.

```sh
brew install cmake ninja llvm
cp CMakeUserPresets.json.mac.example CMakeUserPresets.json

cmake --preset dev-mac
cmake --build --preset dev-mac
source build/dev-mac/activate.sh
```

Use `full-mac` for the complete workspace. It also needs Node.js 22 and npm.
If ccache cannot write to its cache directory:

```sh
CCACHE_DISABLE=1 cmake --build --preset full-mac
```

## Machine-local profiles

Keep local profiles in ignored `CMakeUserPresets.json`:

```json
{
  "version": 6,
  "configurePresets": [
    {
      "name": "my-radio",
      "inherits": "dev",
      "binaryDir": "${sourceDir}/build/my-radio",
      "cacheVariables": {
        "CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX": "${sourceDir}/install/my-radio",
        "GR4_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL": "4",
        "GR4_MODULE_GROUPS": "base;experimental",
        "GR4_BLOCKS_CMAKE_ARGS": "-DENABLE_EXAMPLES=OFF"
      }
    }
  ],
  "buildPresets": [
    {
      "name": "my-radio",
      "configurePreset": "my-radio",
      "jobs": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

Then use it like a supplied profile:

```sh
cmake --preset my-radio
cmake --build --preset my-radio
source build/my-radio/activate.sh
```

See [Module configuration](modules.md) for module selection and the complete
top-level option reference.
