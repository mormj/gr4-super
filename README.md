# GNU Radio 4.0

[![Main CI](https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio4/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main&event=push)](https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio4/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> GNU Radio 4.0 (GR4) is a maturing beta as it approaches its first stable
> release. It is suitable for evaluation, experimentation, and early
> development. GNU Radio 3.x remains the stable release series for users who
> require the existing production-supported platform.

GNU Radio is a free and open-source signal-processing runtime and software
development toolkit. GR4 provides a modern C++23 block API, runtime-loadable
blocks and schedulers, an installed development SDK, and browser and desktop
Studio applications. This repository is the top-level GR4 workspace: it builds
the independently maintained core, library, blocks, incubator, control-plane,
and Studio repositories in dependency order into one development prefix.

## Quick start

Clone the workspace and build the core development stack:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/gnuradio/gnuradio4.git
cd gnuradio4
cmake --preset dev
cmake --build --preset dev
source build/dev/activate.sh
```

Build the complete workspace, including incubator, control-plane, and the
desktop Studio application:

```sh
cmake --preset full
cmake --build --preset full
source build/full/activate.sh
gr4-studio
```

On Ubuntu hosts with restricted unprivileged user namespaces, run
`gr4-studio-sandbox-setup` once before launching Studio. See the
[Studio guide](docs/studio.md#desktop-studio) for details.

Run the published browser Studio image instead:

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/gnuradio/gnuradio4-studio:latest
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 ghcr.io/gnuradio/gnuradio4-studio:latest
```

Then visit <http://localhost:8080>.

The initial build clones missing component repositories into `src/`. After a
checkout exists, the superbuild leaves its Git state alone; you choose when to
fetch, update, or switch its branch.

Docker is the documented container host. Podman is supported as a rootless
alternative; see [CI and containers](docs/ci.md#docker-and-podman).

## Requirements

The core stack requires CMake 3.27+, Ninja, Git, and a C++23 compiler (GCC 14+
or a current Clang). The complete Studio workspace also requires Node.js 22 and
npm. See [Build guide](docs/building.md) for platform setup, profile choices,
and resource limits.

## Workspace components

| Component | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `gnuradio4-core` | Runtime, scheduler, graph/block model, plugins, and SDK |
| `gnuradio4-library` | Reusable DSP algorithms and support libraries |
| `gnuradio4-blocks` | Standard signal-processing and utility blocks |
| `gr4-incubator` | Experimental blocks, schedulers, and utilities |
| `gnuradio4-control-plane` | Runtime and HTTP control service |
| `gnuradio4-studio` | Studio blocks plus browser and desktop application |

## Repository dependencies

```text
Foundation
  [gnuradio4-core]     [gnuradio4-library]
            \             /
             \           /
Modules       [blocks] [incubator] [OOTs]
                  .        .         .
                  `------ runtime plugins ------.
                                                  v
Applications                          [control-plane] --> [studio]
```

Core and library are build dependencies of blocks, incubator, and OOTs; the
control plane depends on core at build time. Dotted paths are runtime plugin
discovery.

The superbuild coordinates the repositories it includes; OOTs remain
independently owned and can be added to the workspace as described in the
[extending guide](docs/extending.md).

## Common commands

```sh
# Run the selected stack's tests and installed-SDK smoke test.
cmake --build --preset dev --target check

# List the supplied configure and build profiles.
cmake --list-presets
cmake --build --list-presets

# Build only standard blocks (required dependencies are selected automatically).
cmake --build --preset dev --target gnuradio4-blocks
```

## Contributing

The repositories under `src/` are ordinary Git working copies. Make component
changes in their owning repository and follow that repository's contribution
guidance. This workspace owns cross-component build orchestration, integration
CI, and shared development workflows.
